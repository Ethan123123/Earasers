## Welcome To The Erase Hitlers Mistakes Project

We are a community of 6th graders who have come together to try to show and teach future generations about Hitler's mistakes.

Our goal is to get to 11 million erasers to represent the 11 million people who died in the holocaust

The 6 million erasers represent the Jewish people who died. The remaining 5 million represnets the blacks, Catholics, Gypsies, homosexuals, disabled, etc...
